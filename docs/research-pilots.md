# From research ideas to inspectable evidence

Initial pilots recorded on 2026-09-14; separately identified follow-ups on 2026-09-19. These are bounded public development pilots, not leaderboard submissions.

| Component | What actually runs | Evidence and limitation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Robot recording review | Qwen3-8B writes code using a non-networked Docker workspace; Skills Anywhere serves a fixed skill through real MCP or a direct adapter; EvalArc independently grades it. | 27 trials across three engineering profiles. All failures retained. No skill accuracy gain; profiles change task context/discovery and cannot be pooled. |
| Skill composition | Four selected skill conditions × three seeds, with a synthetic private marker and exact public-output contract. | 3/12 correct outputs; no marker found in public files or plain model text. Eight explicit grader controls pass. Literal marker scanning is not a general leakage detector. |
| Session handoff | Funes 1.3.0 indexes one explicitly selected public Qwen3-8B session. An initial six-trial pilot injects fixed context; a separate six-trial follow-up lets Qwen3-4B request retrieval through standard MCP. | All follow-up programs remain unchanged at 87.5%, with 0/6 resolved tasks. Separate local model sessions, not native branded-client restore. |
| Harbor | Native task export, oracle/NOP execution, independent import, ATIF 1.8 exports validated with Harbor 0.23.0. | Upstream reward and independently measured acceptance remain separate. Lightweight import is narrower than full upstream schema validation. |
| Scene creation | Real CC0 photogrammetry, Blender 4.5.13 OptiX on L40S, Spark 2.2.0 viewer and an OpenEnv 0.4.2 numeric action interface. | Surface Gaussians are mesh-derived, not trained 3DGS. Collision heightfield is separate and cannot represent overhangs. No RL or aesthetic-quality gain claimed. |
| LIBERO-Plus | Actual native camera and light changes, one paired initial state, pinned SmolVLA on L40S. | 77-action baseline success, 220-action camera step limit, 87-action light success. Not the full benchmark or real hardware. |
| Cosmos Policy | Pinned model/source checks, aligned action-chunk recorder and authenticated dependency-access preflight. | Required NVIDIA Video2World files return 403. No successful Cosmos inference or future-frame result. Model weights use NVIDIA's noncommercial research terms. |

## Inspect the experiments

### Captured-scene robot registration: 2026-09-19

[Scene Lab](https://noteflowai.github.io/robot-reel/scene-lab/) includes two new
six-second Microduck simulations on the original and edited captured terrain.
All 362 frames retain the floating-root pose, body transforms, original camera
and terrain contacts. Both falls/slides are retained. Initial placement follows
each terrain's height, so these are not equal-world-state robustness trials.

Independent checks cover saved-control replay, all native USD/Blender frames,
every browser body and visual transform, and camera projection. The portable
Blender projects were extracted elsewhere and reopened without path edits.
Videos are decoded in full and compared to the corresponding source PNGs.
These establish recorded virtual-scene agreement, not physical calibration.

[Reproduction and measured browser performance](../examples/scene-motion/README.md)
include L40S Vulkan and SwiftShader runs, 1440px/390px viewports, transfer bytes,
render FPS, process memory and the exact measured-file inventory. A narrow
server viewport is not a physical phone measurement. The viewer offers full
geometry, body bounds/proxy and video fallback; it performs no new inference.

### Pinned skill across model sessions: 2026-09-19

[Follow six continuations](https://noteflowai.github.io/evalarc/skill-handoff/)
from the earliest published Qwen3-8B session that loaded the robot-review skill
over MCP. Its outcome was already known when selected. Each Qwen3-4B continuation
receives the same original skill through a workflow-selected MCP preload; three
also have Funes tools for requesting the prior history. Original skill and bundle
hashes are checked when opening the new provider process.

All six workflow preloads succeed. The memory group requests six successful
retrievals, but all six programs remain unchanged, score 0% and fail full task
acceptance. These are delivery and retrieval observations on a public development
task, with model outcomes reported separately. This cohort uses a different
predecessor from the earlier no-additional-skill handoff and is not pooled with it.

The [offline evidence](https://noteflowai.github.io/evalarc/skill-handoff/skill-handoff.zip)
retains all six attempts, 120 frozen files, original and successor MCP receipts,
model-file identities and independent grades. Scripted controls separately check
changed skill versions, empty retrieval, rejected path overrides and source
removal. The unchanged baseline was executed after the cohort.

The shared editable Python environment imported core code from the main checkout.
Observations during and after execution matched all 54 core source files to the
frozen copy; their original collection times are retained. The subsequent recorder
requires its own checkout at startup. [Methods and verification](https://noteflowai.github.io/evalarc/skill-handoff/README.md)
describe this provenance and distinguish workflow preloads from model actions.

### Agent-requested Funes MCP handoff: 2026-09-19

[Six actual continuations](https://noteflowai.github.io/evalarc/funes-handoff/index.html)
start from the same public Qwen3-8B program. Qwen3-4B receives the same task,
initial instructions, protocol diagnostic and interaction budget, with two
additional memory tools in the Funes condition. Three model seeds are paired
in alternating order. The recorder connects through Skills Anywhere's
[standard MCP source example](https://github.com/noteflowai/dsh-skills-anywhere/tree/main/examples/funes-handoff),
which calls native Funes MCP against the selected session.

The three memory trials each call recall and read: six successful retrieval
results in total. None of the six trials writes a file. Every program remains
unchanged at 87.5% and fails the centimeter and millimeter coordinate checks
under two public evaluation seeds. Successful example commands and protocol
responses do not establish numerical correctness.

The report compares command strings and identical file writes with the prior
session, separately from repetitions inside each continuation. Each memory
trial runs one command also found in the prior session; baseline trials skip
commands entirely. These are operation counts, not evidence of reduced work
or time saved. The six earlier trials with pre-injected context remain a
separate cohort.

The source export, program, native receipts, recorder snapshot, model-file
identities, operation counts and independent grades are included in the
[offline bundle](https://noteflowai.github.io/evalarc/funes-handoff/funes-handoff.zip).
Separate native MCP controls exercise retrieval, an empty range, a rejected
memory-path override and removal of the selected Parquet. Those scripted
controls are not additional agent trials. This example does not install
history hooks, collect private sessions or establish general memory efficacy.

### Equal-length context controls: 2026-09-19

[Twelve actual Qwen3-8B attempts](https://noteflowai.github.io/evalarc/context-controls/index.html)
compare relevant robot-review guidance with unrelated prose, delivered through
Skills Anywhere MCP. Both JSON skill-load payloads contain 476 tokens under the
pinned tokenizer, including hashes. The same three seeds receive both conditions.

The initial cohort has 48 response timeouts and 0/6 resolved tasks. A separate
reference check passes under the same grader. A follow-up supplies the same
persistent-request diagnostic and flush instruction to both conditions: three
relevant-guidance programs score 87.5% with numerical errors; the three unrelated-text
attempts submit the unchanged starter. This cohort also resolves 0/6 tasks.

Both six-attempt cohorts retain complete messages, tool receipts, candidate files,
case checks and usage. Their instructions differ and their outcomes are not pooled.
The controls are public development evidence, not held-out or independently authored
validation. [Methods and offline checks](https://noteflowai.github.io/evalarc/context-controls/README.md)
include exact harness snapshots and native tokenizer receipts. These twelve attempts
are separate from the earlier 27-trial skill pilot and three scripted Harbor controls.

### Harbor follow-up: 2026-09-19

[Three native controls](https://noteflowai.github.io/evalarc/harbor-controls/index.html)
now cover a correct program (answer reward 1.0 / program score 1.0), a clock
fault (0.8 / 0.8), and correct answers paired with the faulty program (1.0 / 0.8).
Only the reference passes strict independent acceptance. Each control executed
in a non-root Docker agent environment with a separate verifier; native ATIF
passes Harbor 0.23.0's full schema. Original answers, collected programs,
command outputs and independent evaluations are downloadable.

This is a scripted artifact-verification experiment, not model inference or an
unknown Harbor vulnerability. Task 0.2.0 adds weighted answer reward; task 0.1.0
retains its original binary reward. The preliminary CLI argument error is retained
with the completed experiment. Cosmos dependency access was rechecked on
2026-09-19: both required Video2World files still return authenticated HTTP 403.

## Research motivation and attribution

SkillsBench motivates measuring task outcomes instead of counting installed skills; skill-composition research motivates checking combined behavior and output side effects. Harbor/ATIF motivate portable traces. Cosmos Policy and LIBERO-Plus motivate distinguishing future predictions, native perturbations and measured outcomes. Real2Edit2Real motivates an editable captured-scene workflow. These are engineering applications of ideas, not reproductions of the papers' training results or claims of author endorsement.

Versions, source commits and file hashes accompany individual records.

A wheel-packaging issue found while installing LIBERO-Plus already had an upstream fix proposed. We supplied [additional isolated-wheel validation](https://github.com/sylvestf/LIBERO-plus/pull/54#issuecomment-5663316945), rather than filing a duplicate fix. That is a validation contribution; upstream merge/acceptance is pending.

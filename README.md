## One recording. Two looks.

Drag between the original MuJoCo simulation and its Blender replay. Jump to
the recorded contact, step both views together, then take the editable scene
into your own project.

## Keep the run behind the film

| Watch | Inspect | Reuse |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Browser replays, synchronized views, shot navigation and frame links. | Applied actions, measured poses, recorded outcomes and source revisions. | Offline episodes, MP4s, JSON traces, editable Blender projects and OpenUSD scenes. |

**The evidence travels with the demo.** Validators check file hashes, timestamps,
frame mappings and outcome consistency. Native Blender checks cover all 420
vehicle samples in the directed film and all 362 body transforms in the Newton
import. [Director check](docs/director/animation-check.json) ·
[Newton check](docs/newton/blender-check.json).

The browser plays recorded simulations. The VLA example is one seeded rollout,
with inference waiting time omitted; new director briefs use your connected
agent and a new render. Microduck uses the XML PD-actuator fallback.
[Scope, provenance and asset terms](THIRD_PARTY.md).

## Start from the included recording

Python 3.12+. These commands need only the standard library:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noteflowai/robot-reel.git
cd robot-reel

# Check the recorded policy episode and its evidence.
python3 -m robot_reel.cli vla docs/vla

# Turn the included braking comparison into a checked storyboard.
python3 -m robot_reel.cli direct docs/compare/braking \
  --plan examples/contact-storyboard.json --output artifacts/director
```

Choose the workflow you want to build:

| I want to… | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| Run SmolVLA locally | [Isolated CPU environment + pinned models](docs/vla.md) |
| Let an agent direct a film | [MCP setup + Blender build/render](docs/director.md) |
| Export real physics to a DCC | [Newton → OpenUSD → Blender](docs/newton.md) |
| Record Microduck, braking or the arm | [Recording packs + runtime setup](docs/recording.md) |
| Compare two captured runs | [Comparison contract + CLI](docs/comparison.md) |
